# üé• Movie Explorer App

The Movie Explorer is a web application built using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, designed to let users search for movies and view detailed information about their favorite films. It leverages the OMDB API to fetch real-time data on movies, including titles, posters, plot summaries, cast, and ratings.

The app features an intuitive and responsive user interface that adapts to various screen sizes. Users can search for movies using the search bar, browse through the results, and click on individual movies to view more details.

With the integration of React Router DOM, the app offers smooth navigation between pages, enabling users to easily transition between the home page and individual movie details pages.
